# 📏 QuantityMeasurementApp

> A Java application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to progressively design and refine a quantity measurement system. The project emphasizes incremental development, clean object-oriented design, and continuous refactoring to build a flexible and maintainable domain model over time.

### 📖 Overview

- Modular Java project focused on modelling quantity measurements.
- Organized around incremental Use Cases to evolve the domain design.
- Emphasizes clarity, consistency, and maintainable structure as the system grows.

### ✅ Implemented Features

> _Features will be added here as Use Cases are implemented._
- 🧩 **UC1 – Feet Equality :**
  - Implements value-based equality for feet measurements using an overridden `equals()` method.
  - Establishes object equality semantics as the foundation for future unit comparisons.

- 🧩 **UC2 – Inches Equality :**
  - Extends value-based equality comparison to inches measurements using a dedicated `Inches` class.
  - Maintains independent unit validation while reinforcing equality behaviour across measurement types.

- 🧩 **UC3 – Generic Length :**
  - Refactors unit-specific classes into a unified `Length` abstraction using a `LengthUnit` enum.
  - Eliminates duplicated logic by applying the DRY principle while enabling cross-unit equality comparison.

- 🧩 **UC4 – Extended Unit Support :**
  - Adds Yards and Centimeters to the `LengthUnit` enum with appropriate conversion factors.
  - Demonstrates scalability of the generic design by enabling seamless cross-unit equality without introducing new classes.

- 🧩 **UC5 – Unit-to-Unit Conversion :**
  - Introduces explicit conversion operations between supported length units using centralized enum conversion factors.
  - Extends the `Length` API to convert measurements across units while preserving mathematical equivalence and precision.

- 🧩 **UC6 – Length Addition Operation :**
  - Introduces addition between length measurements with automatic unit normalization and conversion.
  - Returns a new immutable `Length` result expressed in the unit of the first operand while preserving mathematical accuracy.

- 🧩 **UC7 – Addition with Target Unit Specification :**
  - Extends length addition to allow explicit specification of the result unit independent of operand units.
  - Enhances API flexibility by enabling arithmetic results to be expressed in any supported unit while preserving immutability and precision.

- 🧩 **UC8 – Standalone Unit Refactor :**
  - Extracts `LengthUnit` into a standalone enum responsible for all unit conversion logic.
  - Improves architectural separation by delegating conversions to units, reducing coupling and enabling scalable support for future measurement categories.

- 🧩 **UC9 – Weight Measurement Support :**
  - Introduces a weight measurement category with `Weight` and `WeightUnit` supporting kilograms, grams, and pounds.
  - Enables equality, conversion, and addition operations for weight while preserving strict separation from length measurements and stabilizing the shared measurement architecture.

- 🧩 **UC10 – Generic Quantity Architecture :**
  - Introduces a generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` model enabling multiple measurement categories through a shared abstraction.
  - Eliminates category-specific duplication by unifying equality, conversion, and addition logic into a single scalable architecture.

### ⚙️ Development Approach

 > This project follows an incremental **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow:

- Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
- Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
- Each Use Case introduces new functionality in small, controlled steps.
- Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
- Design evolves toward clean, maintainable, and well-tested software.
